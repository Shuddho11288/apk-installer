# Apk-installer
A fast and easy way for installing apk in windows 11 for wsa! A zip file is attached here you just need to extract the main folder  here. If doesn't work open the python file and change adb variable to adb.exe file's absolute path!

# Gui Support
Using the power of tkinter and PyQt5, now it contains gui support. A modern ui, fluent acrylic effects and more... 🥳

# Requirements
- The platform-tools folder must be included as it does the all stuffs.
- Also  windows subsystem for android (AKA wsa similar to wsl) must be installed and enabled developer mode!
